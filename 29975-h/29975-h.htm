<h1>ONE<br />
MARTIAN<br />
AFTERNOON</h1>

<h2>By Tom Leahy</h2>

<p class="hd1"><small>Illustrated by BRUSH</small></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The clod</span> burst in a cloud of
red sand and the little Martian
sand dog ducked quickly into his
burrow. Marilou threw another at
the aperture in the ground and
then ran over and with the inside
of her foot she scraped sand into it
until it was filled to the surface.
She started to leave, but stopped.</p>

<p>The little fellow might choke to
death, she thought, it wasn't his
fault she had to live on Mars. Satisfied
that the future of something
was dependent on her whim, she
dug the sand from the hole. His
little yellow eyes peered out at her.</p>

<p>"Go on an' live," she said magnanimously.</p>

<p>She got up and brushed the sand
from her knees and dress, and
walked slowly down the red road.</p>

<p>The noon sun was relentless; nowhere
was there relief from it.
Marilou squinted and shaded her
eyes with her hand. She looked in
the sky for one of those infrequent
Martian rain clouds, but the deep
blue was only occasionally spotted
by fragile white puffs. Like the sun,
they had no regard for her, either.
They were too concerned with
moving toward the distant mountains,
there to cling momentarily to
the peaks and then continue on
their endless route.</p>

<p>Marilou dabbed the moisture
from her forehead with the hem of
her dress. "I know one thing," she
mumbled. "When I grow up, I'll
get to Earth an' never come back
to Mars, no matter what!"</p>

<p>She broke into a defiant, cadenced
step.</p>

<p>"An' I won't care whether you
an' Mommy like it or not!" she declared
aloud, sticking out her chin
at an imaginary father before her.</p>

<p>Before she realized it, a tiny,
lime-washed stone house appeared
not a hundred yards ahead of her.
That was the odd thing about the
Martian midday; something small
and miles away would suddenly become
large and very near as you approached
it.</p>

<p>The heat waves did it, her father
had told her. "Really?" she had
replied, and&mdash;<i>you think you know
so doggone much</i>, she had thought.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Aunt Twylee!"</span> She broke
into a run. By the Joshua
trees, through the stone gateway
she ran, and with a leap she lit like
a young frog on the porch. "Hi,
Aunt Twylee!" she said breathlessly.</p>

<p>An ancient Martian woman sat
in a rocking chair in the shade of
the porch. She held a bowl of purple
river apples in her lap. Her papyrus-like
hands moved quickly as
she shaved the skin from one. In a
matter of seconds it was peeled.
She looked up over her bifocals at
the panting Marilou.</p>

<p>"Gracious, child, you shouldn't
run like that this time of day," she
said. "You Earth children aren't
used to our Martian heat. It'll
make you sick if you run too
much."</p>

<p>"I don't care! I hate Mars!
Sometimes I wish I could just get
good an' sick, so's I'd get to go
home!"</p>

<p>"Marilou, you <i>are</i> a little tyrant!"
Aunt Twylee laughed.</p>

<p>"Watcha' doin', Aunt Twylee?"
Marilou asked, getting up from her
frog posture and coming near the
old Martian lady's chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, peeling apples, dear. I'm
going to make a cobbler this afternoon."
She dropped the last apple,
peeled, into the bowl. "There,
done. Would you like a little cool
apple juice, Marilou?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;you betcha! Hey, could
I watch you make the cobbler,
Aunt Twylee, could I? Mommy
can't make it for anything&mdash;it tastes
like glue. Maybe, if I could see how
you do it, maybe I could show her.
Do you think?"</p>

<p>"Now, Marilou, your mother
must be a wonderful cook to have
raised such a healthy little girl. I'm
sure there's nothing she could learn
from me," Aunt Twylee said as she
arose. "Let's go inside and have
that apple juice."</p>

<p>The kitchen was dark and cool,
and filled with the odors of the
wonderful edibles the old Martian
had created on and in the Earth-made
stove. She opened the Earth-made
refrigerator that stood in the
corner and withdrew an Earth-made
bottle filled with Martian apple juice.</p>

<p>Marilou jumped up on the table
and sat cross-legged.</p>

<p>"Here, dear." Aunt Twylee
handed her a glass of the icy liquid.</p>

<p>"Ummm, thanks," Marilou said,
and gulped down half the contents.
"That tastes dreamy, Aunt Twylee."</p>

<p>The little girl watched the old
Martian as she lit the oven and
gathered the necessary ingredients
for the cobbler. As she bent over to
get a bowl from the shelf beneath
Marilou's perch, her hair brushed
against the child's knee. Her hair
was soft, soft and white as a puppy's,
soft and white like the down
from a dandelion. She smiled at
Marilou. She always smiled; her
pencil-thin mouth was a perpetual
arc.</p>

<p>Marilou drained the glass.
"Aunt Twylee&mdash;is it true what my
daddy says about the Martians?"</p>

<p>"True? How can I say, dear? I
don't know what he said."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean, that when us
Earth people came, you Martians
did inf ... infan ..."</p>

<p>"Infanticide?" Aunt Twylee interrupted,
rolling the dough on the
board a little flatter, a little faster.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it&mdash;killed babies,"
Marilou said, and took an apple
from the bowl. "My daddy says you
were real primitive, an' killed your
babies for some silly religious reason.
I think that's awful! How
could it be religious? God couldn't
like to have little babies killed!"
She took a big bite of the apple;
the juice ran from the corners of
her mouth.</p>

<p>"Your daddy is a very intelligent
man, Marilou, but he's partially
wrong. It is true&mdash;but not for religious
reasons. It was a necessity.
You must remember, dear, Mars is
very arid&mdash;sterile&mdash;unable to sustain
many living things. It <i>was</i> awful,
but it was the only way we
knew to control the population."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Marilou looked</span> down
her button nose as she picked
a brown spot from the apple.
"Hmmph, I'll tell 'im he's wrong,"
she said. "He thinks he knows so
damn much!"</p>

<p>"Marilou!" Aunt Twylee exclaimed
as she looked over her
glasses. "A sweet child like you
shouldn't use such language!"</p>

<p>Marilou giggled and popped the
remaining portion of the apple in
her mouth.</p>

<p>"Do your parents know where
you are, child?" Aunt Twylee
asked, as she took the bowl from
Marilou's hands. She began dicing
the apples into a dough-lined casserole.</p>

<p>"No, they don't," Marilou replied.
She sprayed the air with little
particles of apple as she talked.
"Everybody's gone to the hills to
look for the boys."</p>

<p>"The boys?" Aunt Twylee
stopped her work and looked at the
little girl.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Jimmy an' Eddie an' some
of the others disappeared from the
settlement this morning. The
men're afraid they've run off to th'
hills an' the renegades got 'em."</p>

<p>"Gracious," Aunt Twylee said;
her brow knitted into a criss-cross
of wrinkles.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know those dopes.
They're prob'ly down at th' canals&mdash;fishin'
or somep'n."</p>

<p>"Just the same, your mother will
be frantic, dear. You should have
told her where you were going."</p>

<p>"I don't care," Marilou said
with unadulterated honesty. "She'll
be all right when I get home."</p>

<p>Aunt Twylee shook her head
and clucked her tongue.</p>

<p>"Can I have another glass?
Please?"</p>

<p>The old lady poured the glass
full again. And then she sprinkled
sugar down among the apple cubes
in the casserole and covered them
with a blanket of dough. She cut
an uneven circle of half moons in
it and put it in the oven. "There&mdash;all
ready to bake, Marilou," she
sighed.</p>

<p>"It looks real yummy, Aunt Twylee."</p>

<p>"Well, I certainly hope it turns
out good, dear," she said, wiping
her forehead with her apron. She
looked out the open back door.
The landscape was beginning to
gray as heavier clouds moved down
from the mountains and pressed the
afternoon heat closer, more oppressively
to the ground. "My, it's getting
hot. I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if we didn't get a little rain
this afternoon, Marilou." She
turned back to the little girl. "Tell
me some more about your daddy,
dear. We Martians certainly owe a
lot to men like your father."</p>

<p>"That's what he says too. He
says, you Martians would have died
out in a few years, if we hadn't
come here. We're so much more
civi ... civili ..."</p>

<p>"Civilized?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. He says, we were so much
more 'civ-ilized' than you that we
saved your lives when we came
here with all our modern stuff."</p>

<p>"Well, that's true enough, dear.
Just look at that wonderful Earth
stove," Aunt Twylee said, and
laughed. "We wouldn't be able to
bake an apple cobbler like that
without it, would we?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;rumble</span> of thunder shouldered
through the crowded
hot air.</p>

<p>"No. He says, you Martians are
kinda likeable, but you can't be
trusted. He's nuts! <i>I</i> like you Martians!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, child, but everyone's
entitled to his own opinion.
Don't judge your daddy too severely,"
Aunt Twylee said as she
scraped spilled sugar from the
table and put little bits of it on her
tongue.</p>

<p>"He says that you'd bite th' hand
that feeds you. He says, we brought
all these keen things to Mars, an'
that if you got th' chance, you'd
kill all of us!"</p>

<p>"Gracious," said Aunt Twylee as
she speared scraps of dough with
the point of her long paring knife.</p>

<p>"He's a dope!" Marilou said.</p>

<p>Aunt Twylee opened the oven
and peeked in at the cobbler. The
aroma of the simmering apples
rushed out and filled the room.</p>

<p>"Could I have some cobbler
when it's done?" Marilou asked,
her mouth filling with saliva.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, child. It's getting
rather late."</p>

<p>The thunder rumbled again&mdash;a
little closer, a little louder.</p>

<p>The old lady washed the blade
of the knife in the sink. "Tell me
more of what your father says,
dear," she said as she adjusted the
bifocals on her thin nose and ran
her thumb along the length of the
knife's blade.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin' much more. He just
says that you'd kill us if you had th'
chance. That's the way the inferior
races always act, he says. They want
to kill th' people that help 'em,
'cause they resent 'em."</p>

<p>"Very interesting."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't so, is it, Aunt Twylee?"</p>

<p>The room was filled with blinding
blue-white light, and the walls
quaked at the sound of a monstrous
thunderclap.</p>

<p>The old Martian glanced nervously
at the clock on the wall. "My,
it <i>is</i> getting late," she said as she
fondled the knife in her hands.</p>

<p>"You Martians wouldn't do anything
like that, would you?"</p>

<p>"You want the truth, don't you,
dear?" Aunt Twylee asked, smiling,
as she walked to the table where
Marilou sat.</p>

<p>"'Course I do, Aunt Twylee,"
she said.</p>

<p>Her scream was answered and
smothered by the horrendous roar
of the thunder, and the piercing
hiss of the rain that fell in sheets.
In great volumes of water, it fell, as
though the heavens were attempting
to wash the sins of man from
the universe and into non-existence
in the void beyond the void.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Marilou lay</span> beside the
other children. Aunt Twylee
smiled at them, closed the bedroom
door and returned to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The storm had moved on; the
thunder was the faint grumbling of
a pacified old man. What water fell
was a monotonous trickle from the
eaves of the lime-washed stone
house. Aunt Twylee washed the
blood from the knife and wiped it
dry on her apron. She opened the
oven and took out the browned
cobbler. Sweet apple juice bubbled
to the surface through the half
moons and burst in delights of sugary
aroma. The sun broke through
the thinning edge of the thunderhead.</p>

<p>Aunt Twylee brushed a lock of
her feathery white hair from her
moist cheek. "Gracious," she said,
"I must tidy up a bit before the
others come."</p>

<p class="hd2">THE END</p>
